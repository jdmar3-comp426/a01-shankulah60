    <h1>Modern Representations of Medusa</h1>
    <p>
        The story of Medusa has been so influential throughout time, that there are numerous allusions to it, or even
        explicit references to it in modern culture.
        <br>
        <br>
        In pop culture, the snake-headed terrifying image of Medusa is instantly recognizable to many. The Medusa myth
        has enjoyed a re-emergence since the story was featured in the "Clash of the Titans" movies which came out in 1981 and
        was redone in 2010. Additionally, the movie "Percy Jackson and the Olympians", which also came out in 2010, also featured
        the story of Medusa.
