        When Medusa was represented in Art, usually only her head was shown, as it contianed the most illustrative features that people
        were taken aback by. In many of these head representations, she is depicted as having a broad face, sometimes with tusks, and
        the characteristic feature of having snakes in place of hair. In other less common depictions, she is shown as having fangs, a forked tongue,
        and bulging eyes.
