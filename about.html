    <h1>About Medusa</h1>

    <p>
        Medusa is believed to be a divine figure of ancient Greek mythology. 
        She is said to be one of three Gorgon sisters, however Medusa was the only
        sister that was NOT immortal.

        Greek mythology claims that Medusa was once a beautiful priestess of Athena
        who was, at some point, cursed for breaking her vow of celibacy.
        <br>
        She is believed to have had an affair with the sea God Poseidon, and is therefore
        punished by Athena. Athena is believed to have turned Medusa into a hideous woman, 
        making her hair into venomous snakes and her skin turn a horrid green color. In addition,
        anyone who gazed into her eyes would turn to stone.

        A hero by the name of Perseus was sent on a quest to slay Medusa. He was able to defeat her
        in battle by chopping off her head, which he was able to do becuase he used the reflection of 
        Medusa in his shield to locate her and eventually chop off her head. It is believed that he later
        used the chopped off head of Medusa as a weapon, using it to turn his enemies into stone.
